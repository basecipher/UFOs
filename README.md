Intro to JS & HTML

## Overview of Project
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results  
I found out that a user is easily able to search UFO sightings by multiple criterias.  Through means of accessing my website and scrolling down, the user will be able to find a data table that displays the list of reported UFO sightings that have been documented.
The user, if they choose, wants to see the sightings on lets say 10th, 2011 in Vermont they would enter that date in the first filter box and enter "VT" in the state filter. 

## Summary
The drawback of the design is if user chooses a criteria thats not in table no result will show but; that in itself is fine but this leaves user wanting a better search filter.  Search filter could be improved by allowing a auto-fill list appear for potential results as user is typing.  This way user knows they are on the right track with their search entry.  I would also recommend a quick reset button on page to clar all search criteria all at once.
