## Overview of Project
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results  
I found out that a user is easily able to search UFO sightings by multiple criterias.  Through means of accessing my website and scrolling down, the user will be able to find a data table that displays the list of reported UFO sightings that have been documented.
The user, if they choose, wants to see the sightings on lets say 10th, 2011 in Vermont they would enter that date in the first filter box and enter "VT" in the state filter. 

## Summary
*The index.html file has the following: The list element for the button is removed. ALL FIVE list elements for filtering are created. The app.js file has the following: The event listener is modified to detect changes to ALL FIVE filters. The updateFilters() function saves the element, value, and the id of the filter that was changed. The filterTable() function loops through all of the filters and keeps any data that matches the filter values. The webpage filters the table based on user input.
*The written analysis has ALL of the following: There is a title, and there are multiple paragraphs. Each paragraph has a heading. There are subheadings. Images are correct and displayed where appropriate.
*The Deliverable Fulfills "Emerging" Required Criteria: AND has the following: The summary addresses a drawback of the design. The summary has TWO recommendations for further development.
